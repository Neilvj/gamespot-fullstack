# GameSpot – Fullstack Inventory Project

GameSpot is a beginner-friendly fullstack web application for managing a game inventory.
The project was built as a learning exercise to practice backend APIs, database relations,
and frontend CRUD interaction.

This repository represents a completed MySQL-based fullstack project, created before
rebuilding the backend with MongoDB and Mongoose for a separate assignment.
